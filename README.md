# AddressBloc CLI Project Created During my Bloc Software Developer Bootcamp

## AddressBloc Is a ruby command line interface created to recieve address information as input data and then return it if called on during the session.

### Also checkout [BlocRecord](https://github.com/Jdcorley/bloc_record) another project I did later to extend data persistence and gain insight into how object relation mapping works.
